## 1Tac Admin Tool
1Tac Admin Tool is an Arma 3 administration tool, designed to provide admins and session hosts with tools they can use.

If you wish to use this admin tool for your community ensure that in func/fn_keyPressed.sqf you modify it so that included steam profiles do not include the default ones, otherwise myself and 1tac admin's will have access to this if we come to your community.

**To use in-game press:** Shift+F1

**Note:** You must be in single player mode, logged in to ingame admin or in the whitelist to use it.
