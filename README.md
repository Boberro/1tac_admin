# 1tac_admin
1tac admin is an Arma 3 admin tool, designed to provide admins and session hosts with tools they can use.

To use: Shift+F1 keys
You must be in single player, or logged in as an admin or in the whitelist to use it.

If you wish to use this admin tool for your community ensure that in func/fn_keyPressed.sqf you modify it so that included steam profiles do not include the default ones, otherwise myself and 1tac admin's will have access to this if we come to your community.
